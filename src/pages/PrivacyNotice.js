      <p>
        Zeeguu is a research project. Our goal is to discover ways in which
        learning a foreign language is more fun.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <b>only personal information</b> that we store about you is the{' '}
        <b>name and email</b> you provide on this page. We do not share it with
        anybody. We need it to send you a reset password code, important
        announcements about the platform, and possibly a survey at some point.
      </p>

      <p>
        We store <b>anonymized data</b> about your{' '}
        <b>interactions with foreign language texts and vocabulary exercises</b>{' '}
        together with the <b>times of these interactions</b>. They help us
        estimate the words you know, the ones you should learn, recommend texts,
        and approximate time spent studying.
      </p>

      <p>
        We might make the anonymized interaction data available for other
        researchers too. In research, data can be even more important than
        algorithms.
